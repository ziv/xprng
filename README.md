## Why?

Well, this is not another components library, but rather a collection of micro packages that provide simple, yet smart components that can be used in any Angular application.

The components are designed to be **lightweight**, easy to use, and highly customizable. They are built with the latest Angular features and best practices in mind.

The components are **not opinionated**, meaning you can use them in any way you like, without being forced to follow a specific design or architecture.

The components are shipped **without styles**, but rather with a set of directives and classes that can be used to style the components in any way you like. This allows you to use the components in your own design system without having to worry about styles.

For any questions, issues, or feature requests, feel free to contact me, or open an issue in this repository.
