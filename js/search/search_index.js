This should be a valid language identifier supported by Shiki.\ntheme: The theme to use for syntax highlighting. This can be any theme supported by Shiki.\nhighlighter: A custom highlighter function (Should be an instance of Shiki's HighlighterCore).\n\nNested Content\nThe component supports nested content for different states, loading, error, and empty states.\nSee the example below for how to use these states.\nExamples\nImporting the component\nExample :import { Code } from \"@xprng/code\";Importing
